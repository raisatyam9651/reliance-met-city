                    <!-- Strategic Advantages -->
                    <h2 id="strategic-advantages">Why Global Corporations Choose Reliance MET City</h2>
                    <p>The presence of these multinational giants is not accidental. Companies choose MET City due to several structural and geographical advantages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Excellent Connectivity:</b> The township is directly connected to the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, NH-8 (Delhi-Jaipur Highway), and NH-10. It is also close to the Dwarka Expressway, reducing travel time to Gurugram.</li>
                        <li><b>Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC):</b> Proximity to the DFC rail link allows companies to transport cargo to Gujarat and Maharashtra ports in a fraction of the time required by road.</li>
                        <li><b>Clear Title and Legal Safety:</b> Being backed by Reliance Industries ensures that all lands acquired are free from litigation and legal title disputes, providing total peace of mind for corporate boards investing capital.</li>
                        <li><b>Grade-A Infrastructure:</b> MET City offers pre-cleared industrial plots with plug-and-play utilities, including high-voltage power grids, water supply, sewage treatment plants, and high-speed internet.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- Real Estate Impact -->
                    <h2 id="real-estate-impact">Impact of Industrial Anchors on Residential & Commercial Value</h2>
                    <p>For retail real estate investors, the massive concentration of multinational companies at MET City is a strong indicator of future growth. An industrial hub employing thousands of engineers, logistics managers, and laborers naturally creates a demand for residential housing and commercial support services.</p>
                    <p>As companies like Panasonic, Denso, and Saab expand their workforce, the demand for residential plots within the township's gated communities is expected to grow. Similarly, the commercial SCO (Shop-cum-Office) plots will serve as retail hubs, restaurants, and bank branches for the local workforce. This makes early investment in the residential and commercial sectors of MET City highly lucrative, backed by real economic activity and job creation rather than mere speculation.</p>
